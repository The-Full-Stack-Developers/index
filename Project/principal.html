					    <p>I extend a warm welcome to you and your family. I am very proud to be the Principal of this wonderful school. It is a privilege for me to work with our students, our staff and our families to make our school they very best it can be. My aim is to lead our school community to enable us to work together to achieve our goals.</p>

 

						<p>We aim to create a safe, nurturing yet challenging environment that is built on positive relationships; developing the whole student – emotionally, socially and academically. We care for and appreciate each of our students as the unique individuals that they are, each with distinct talents, interests and needs, and each with differing learning styles.</p>

 

						
						<p>Pioneer Academy Lalganj is a friendly, vibrant, community-minded school, whose decisions always put our students first. We are very keen to involve our community in our learning, developing true partnerships that value each student. There are many opportunities for parental and community involvement. We hope that through your participation and interest you will also come to feel very much a part of our school and its warm and generous community.</p>

 

						<p>We look forward to meeting you soon.<br>Hope Your Day’s a Diamond!<br>Helen Micallef</p></div>
